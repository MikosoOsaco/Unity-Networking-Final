# Unity-Networking-Final
Team of 3. We made a RPG where you have to fight through monsters of a dungeon, before battling the boss to escape.

Path finding included using Unity's Navmesh, for all enemies. 

State machine included for boss, switches between idle, chase, attack, and death. 


Animations and music included.
